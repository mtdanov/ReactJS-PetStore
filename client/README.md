# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
  This is my react project for Softuni, react js course.

Usage

1. Clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/mtdanov/ReactJS-PetStore.git`

2. Start the Server

Open a new terminal window in the root directory of the project and navigate to the server:

`cd server`

Install server dependencies:

`npm install`

Start the server in development mode:

`npm run start`

3. Setup the Client

Open a new terminal window in the root directory of the project and navigate to the client:

`cd client`

Install client dependencies:

`npm install`

Start the client in development mode:

`npm run dev`

Now when the client setup is complete you can open the following link in your web browser: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

These instructions are intended for users operating on the Windows OS.
